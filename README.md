## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- Tailwind CSS
- ReactJS with Typescript
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

In this project I learned how to use ReactJS with Typescript and Tailwind CSS for styling.

### Continued development

- Making this project as a fullstack app
- Since this is my first time using TypeScript and Tailwind, I believe there may be ways to refactor my code. However, at this point, I still don't know where I can refactor it.
